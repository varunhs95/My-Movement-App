# My-Movement-App

This App was created for the Kovai Techathon 2015 held in Coimbatore in February 2015.
The theme for the hackathon was to create an app for addressing any social issues etc.
This app can tag places in the map with an event so that people can join and contribute or solve an event.
For example: If a dirty road or a dumpster is found, a person can place a marker at the spot in the map and add an hashtag to it. People can view that event in the app and come to that place to help clean up the place.
